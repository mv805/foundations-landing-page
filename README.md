## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a basic website challenge to replicate a given prompt without any hints or solutions. The process required alot of online reference to get all the elements looking exactly as desired. 

I spent my time replicating as close as possible to the design prompt.

I wanted to try a new approach with dual style sheets. One for fonts and colors and one for layouts only (size, shape and location). This turned out to be a big confusing mess and I will not attemp this in the future. Instead I will opt for a single simple style sheet and I can organize the styling however I want in one sheet.
